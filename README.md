### A little about me

As a development and cyber Security student, seeing projects taking shape is what I love, it's amazing to be able to learn more and more, use creativity and know how much I can improve people's experience through this, it's what makes me love even more working with the technology and Cyber Security. As a professional, I am always looking to improve my performance to achieve my goals.

In life I value friendships and family, I value being always present to enjoy every moment with the people I love.
